# Euler-s-number
Uniform sums and Eulerâ€™s number 

Suppose I sample values uniformly at random from the unit interval. How many samples should I expect to take before the sum of my sampled values exceeds unity?
well in this Jupyter Notebook we sumulate it with 10^6 test and then we get average of it.
